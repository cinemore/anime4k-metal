# Changelog

## 0.1.4

- Move the release workflow from the retiring `macos-14` runner to the supported `macos-15` runner.
- Preserve arm64, Intel x86_64, and universal CLI archives with their bundled Metal resources.
- Library and CLI behavior are unchanged.

## 0.1.3

- Reuse intermediate textures and shared workspaces while preserving delivered output buffers.
- Fuse eligible final outputs and adjacent convolutions with matching inputs without changing the shader weights or sampling rules.
- Check pipeline caches before loading GLSL and compile only enabled shader paths; fall back to original passes if optional fusion cannot compile.
- Add resource reuse/reset coverage and validate CLI resource bundles during release packaging.
- Document version-pinned Swift package dependencies.
